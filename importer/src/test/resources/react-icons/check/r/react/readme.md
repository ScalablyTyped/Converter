# Scala.js typings for react




## Note
This library has been generated from typescript code from first party type definitions.

Provided with :purple_heart: from [ScalablyTyped](https://github.com/oyvindberg/ScalablyTyped)

## Usage
See [the main readme](../../readme.md) for instructions.

## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/*
React projects that don't include the DOM library need these interfaces to compile.
React Native applications use React, but there is no DOM available. The JavaScript runtime
is ES6/ES2015 only. These definitions allow such projects to compile with only `--lib ES6`.
